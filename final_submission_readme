I. To use other three models.
To use other models:
They are located in the unused_model folder. Each model is made up of two .m files: one init_model file, the other one is prediciton_model file. To use the model, run the init_model function, and then run the predition_model function.
init_model_SVD	prediction_SVD
init_model_nb	prediction_nb

II. How we train our models
We train all our models in the model_script.m file(in unused_model subfolder). For different models, you could use different flags to train. The model we used to pass the test is trained as follows: we use the 250000 data set(default) and use package Logistic regression(model = train(Y, X, '-s 7 -c 0.06 -e 0.001 -q')) from liblinear package. 
For naive Bays model, we used matlab original nb.
For SVDs, the feature is too big, so first we pick the most frequent words, throw away the words that appear less than 100 times. Then we do a fast SVDs(fsvd, included in the folder), we pick the first 500 components. This one is still time-consuming.
For adding features, we add the punctuations of the review text as additional features(10 features).


III. Additional Information
Other models we tried are trained using different methods(included in final report).
In detail:
0. Load the data.

1. You need to setup your training set first. There are several flags and a switch case help you do this(to facilitate debug).
data_comb flag: you could set your train data and test data. default is 25000 train data, empty test data.

2. You could add some additional features to your training set. This including review length, punctuation info, stemmer info, IDF info, frequency info. The corresponding flags are as follows:
review_length_flag = 0;
add_punc_flag = 0;
freq_flag = 0;  


3. You could also eliminate some features to increase the accuracy or reduce the data amount to boost the training process. It's also control by flags:
porterStemmer_flag = 0;
stemmed_X_flag = 0;
stopwords_process_flag = 0;
stopwords_use_flag = 0;
idf_flag = 0;
SVDs_flag = 1;

4. We also include a rescaling process, but it doesn't work well. 
scale_flag = 0;
standardization_flag = 0;
normalization_flag = 0;

5. This part includes the control flag for the models. You could use several models separately.
SVM_flag = 0;   % too slow, some problem?
SVM_liblinear_flag = 0;
LG_flag = 0;
NB_flag = 0;
KNN_flag = 0;   % to be implemented
discriminant_flag = 0;
kmeans_flag = 0;
